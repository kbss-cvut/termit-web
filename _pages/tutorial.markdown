System TermIt is designed to manage terms and vocabularies, assign them to documents and other resources and interconnect them. Basic tutorial focuses on those activities, describing step by step how to:
* search for terms and browse vocabularies,
* look for occurrences and definitions in documents,
* create new vocabulary and set of terms,
* assigning document to the vocabulary and annotate it.

In the future, advanced tutorial will show more advanced features. Also, feature documentation with full description of single features (not focused on activities) will be added.

# Sandbox
On the page <a href="pagewillbehere.com">pagewillbehere.com</a> you can find a sandbox deployment of TermIt. It contains few vocabularies filled with terms and with attached documents, annotated with terms from the vocabularies. Users have unlimited access to all vocabularies, however the state of the TermIt regularly (at least once a day) returns to the original content.

# Basic tutorials
We suggest that the most important tasks to do in TermIt are browsing it for terms, adding new terms and vocabularies, editing them and annotate documents or other resources by the terms.

## Search for terms and browse vocabularies

One of the fundamental tasks is to search the TermIt for the specific term. By term in TermIt is meant a concept in the one specified context, e.g. building may be represented by two terms, while one term represents an object and the second represents a process. Terms are usually defined within a context of a vocabulary, e.g. vocabulary of a specific legislation document.

Lets find a term "Lokalita" from the vocabulary "Slovník Pražských stavebních předpisů 2016 - slovník".

### Search bar
The easiest way to search for a term is to use a search bar located in the upper part of the page.

### Second step
Second step is to do this, too.

## Tutorial on doing this and that
This is much easier than that.
