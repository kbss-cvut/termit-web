# Installation

TermIt can be easily setup through Docker Compose, setting up all necessary services and dependencies. Details are described [here](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/termit-docker).

An alternative (more complicated) is to install and wire up the services independently. Follow individual installation instructions for setting up each service:
- [TermIt](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/termit-ui)
- [TermIt Server](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/termit)
