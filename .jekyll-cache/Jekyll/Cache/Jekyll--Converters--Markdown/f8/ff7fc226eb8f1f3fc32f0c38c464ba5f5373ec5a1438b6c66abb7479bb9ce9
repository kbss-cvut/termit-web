<p>TermIt is a system for management of terms and vocabularies and their interconnection to legislation (or other documents) and other vocabularies.</p>

<p>Motivation to create such a system originates in a need to describe terms used by different groups of experts to make them understand each other without a need to learn new terminology. Without being an ontology expert, it was impossible to achieve the aforementioned goal. The tool helps domain experts to create ontological glossaries and interconnect their terms to other vocabularies.</p>

              <p>TermIt runs on Institute of Planning and Development of Prague (IPR) since 2021. TermIt was originally created in the project OPPPR and IPR tested its usability â€“ to describe Metropolitan plan and help to relate it to the legislation. Nowadays, TermIt serves for systemization of terminology in other projects, e.g. Uniform Interchangeable Format of the Digital Technical Map (JVF DTM) and Building Intelligence Model (BIM).</p>
