<p>TermIt can be easily setup through Docker Compose, setting up all necessary services and dependencies. Details are described <a href="https://github.com/kbss-cvut/termit-docker">here</a>.</p>

<p>An alternative (more complicated) is to install and wire up the services independently. Follow individual installation instructions for setting up each service:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kbss-cvut/termit-ui">TermIt</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kbss-cvut/termit">TermIt Server</a></li>
</ul>
